# Project 3: Spots

### Overview  

**This is a travel photo-sharing website I replicated from a Figma design. It's a fun and vibrant space where globetrotters can show off their favorite travel snaps, explore amazing places through other people's lenses, and maybe even catch the itch to plan their next adventure!**

**Intro**
  
The Spots project I replicated was created to  focus on making the website look efficient and function properly on all kinds of devices—whether someone is browsing on a large desktop monitor, a laptop, a tablet, or even a small phone screen. The goal is to make sure that everything—text, images, buttons, and other elements—resizes and adjusts in a way that feels natural and easy to use, no matter the screen size.
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
